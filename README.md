For Applied Machine Learning (AAI 695) 

jazz-arima.ipynb contains initial time series analysis of data 

jazz-rnn.ipynb contains final RNN model 

# To Run Project: 
download Weimar Jazz Database from
https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/download/downloads/wjazzd.db ) and put in the root of Google Drive.
